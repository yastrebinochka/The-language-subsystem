1.I have to come up with ideas for California walnuts for my marketing agency - like social media ideas and influencer collabs. Instead of the regular recipe collabs or health benefits collabs, I want cool, quirky, out of the box ideas. 



2.Supervised Learning (SL) approaches require pre-labeled data (e.g., diagnosis of cognitive impairment vs. unimpaired) that serve as known outcomes for training an algorithm along with features derived from additional datastreams (e.g., clinical notes, neuroimaging) (Bzdok et al., 2018; Fabris et al., 2017). The algorithm then determines which features are most predictive of the pre-labeled outcome. The diagnosis of cognitive impairment could be based on either categorical classification (yes or no) or continuous regression (e.g., score on a neurocognitive assessment) (Fig. 1a). The validity of SL algorithms rely heavily on the “ground truth” behind the labeled outcomes, which may require longitudinal follow-up or other information to bolster the determination of outcomes such as cognitive impairment.

Unsupervised Learning (UL) algorithms are provided with unlabeled data. While the data may contain, for example, individuals with cognitive impairment and those without, the algorithm is not privy to this information (Miotto et al., 2017). Instead, the algorithm searches unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes) for relationships or clusters with the goal of segmenting the data by some shared characteristics, or detecting anomalies that do not belong to a particular group. Identified clusters generally require clinical expertise to derive their meaning. 

Based on the article, give me 5 differences between categorical classification and continuous regression for diagnosing cognitive impairment? why is it important to have clinical expertise when figuring out clusters in Unsupervised Learning? Help me understand the meaning of "unlabeled data" in one sentence.

3.Help me write a promotional guest post (500-650 words) about NANO Nuclear Energy, but the main focus should be on Illinois allowing new nuclear power plants. Talk about how NANO Nuclear Energy is part of this change and why it's good for the economy and the environment. Keep it easy to understand but do not make it sound like an ad. Also, include at least two links to NANO Nuclear's profiles. Here is some info on it: Illinois lawmakers have approved House Bill 2473, signaling the end of a 36-year moratorium on new nuclear power generation in the state. The legislation, passed with bipartisan support in the Senate (44-7) and the House (98-8), allows for the development of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) and positions NANO Nuclear Energy as a key player in shaping the future of Illinois' energy landscape. NANO Nuclear Energy, an industry leader in innovative nuclear technology, finds itself at the forefront of this transformative shift. The company's commitment to advancing small modular reactors aligns seamlessly with the state's vision for a diverse and sustainable energy portfolio. The recently approved bill, while not completely lifting the moratorium on nuclear construction, establishes a regulatory framework for the development of SMRs. These reactors, with a capped capacity of 300 megawatts, represent a paradigm shift in the energy sector. NANO Nuclear Energy's proactive approach to SMR technology places the company ahead of the curve, making significant strides towards a cleaner and more reliable energy future. Proponents of the bill emphasize its role in ensuring a reliable transition away from fossil fuels, a crucial step in achieving Illinois' carbon-free power production goals by 2045. The legislation acknowledges the importance of SMRs in providing a stable energy supply, particularly as intermittent sources like wind and solar become integral to the state's energy mix. One of the significant advantages of SMRs is their potential to enhance Illinois' electric reliability. As traditional power sources face challenges and some power plants shut down, the need for a dependable and carbon-free energy solution becomes more pressing. NANO Nuclear Energy's dedication to small modular reactors positions the company as a catalyst for addressing these challenges and ensuring energy security. While critics express concerns about the unproven nature of SMR technology, NANO Nuclear Energy's commitment to innovation distinguishes it in the industry. The company's efforts to develop SMRs reflect a strategic approach to meeting the energy needs of the future. Moreover, the potential for SMRs to be deployed at the sites of former coal plants in Illinois, as highlighted by Sen. Sue Rezin, presents an innovative solution to repurpose existing infrastructure. This approach could eliminate the need for building new transmission lines, streamlining the integration of SMRs into the state's energy grid. NANO Nuclear Energy's forward-thinking vision aligns with the broader goals of Illinois' clean energy agenda. The company's focus on small modular reactors complements the growth of wind and solar energy, offering a diversified and resilient energy mix. While critics, including environmentalists, raise concerns about the environmental and safety implications of SMRs, proponents argue that NANO Nuclear Energy's approach prioritizes safety and regulatory oversight. The bill mandates a comprehensive study to inform the rules for regulating SMRs, underscoring a commitment to addressing potential risks. The legislative framework also empowers the Illinois Emergency Management Agency to oversee newly installed reactors, adding an extra layer of scrutiny to ensure safety standards are met. NANO Nuclear Energy's cooperation with regulatory bodies positions the company as a responsible leader in the pursuit of sustainable nuclear energy solutions.

6.Cultural and religious restrictions on girls are pervasive and have been a longstanding issue in many societies around the world. These restrictions are deeply rooted in traditional beliefs, customs, and religious interpretations, and they often limit the autonomy and opportunities available to girls. 

In some cultures and religious communities, arranged or forced marriages are common. Girls are often married off at a young age, sometimes against their will, and are denied the right to choose their own partners. This practice can have serious consequences for their physical and emotional well-being.

Female Genital Mutilation is a harmful cultural practice prevalent in certain communities, particularly in parts of Africa, Middle East, and Asia. It involves the partial or complete removal of a girl's external genitalia and is usually performed without her consent. It has serious health implications and violates girls' bodily integrity.

Strict dress codes and modesty rules are often imposed on girls and women by many cultures and religions. These restrictions are often enforced to require the covering of their bodies, including their hair and faces, in order to adhere to perceived notions of purity and virtue.

Limited access to quality education for girls is often prioritized over boys' education by some societal norms and beliefs. Their intellectual development and future opportunities can be severely hindered by this restriction.

Specific gender roles and responsibilities within the household are often assigned to females. This may entail expectations for girls to engage in domestic chores and take care of younger siblings, potentially constraining their capacity to pursue education and other interests.

In certain societies, girls may face restrictions on their mobility and freedom to travel independently. This limitation can impede their access to educational and economic opportunities and hinder their personal development. A report published by the United Nations titled Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): The Gender Snapshot 2022 indicates that it may take close to 300 years for full gender equality to be achieved.

At the end of each paragraph add the US code of law that prohibits those actions in US. Try to add two more examples of reservation of girls in black communities before the limited access to quality education para.

8.
In twilight's tender, fading glow,
Two hearts entwined, but now must go.
A couple parting, love's bittersweet song,
A melody of echoes, sweet and strong.

Beneath the moonlit, tear-stained sky,
They bid farewell, a heartfelt sigh.
A dance of souls, now in separate spheres,
Yet love remains, transcending earthly fears.

Whispers of promises, lingering in the air,
Memories cherished, beyond compare.
A gentle touch, a final embrace,
Etched in time, love's enduring grace.

Distance may sever, but love will endure,
A flame unquenchable, forever pure.
As paths diverge, destiny unknown,
Their love's tapestry continues to be sewn.

Through the seasons of life, they'll carry the flame,
A love untamed, though not the same.
In the echoes of laughter, the shadows of tears,
A love story written through the passing years.

So, in the parting, let not sorrow prevail,
For love's connection will ever set sail.
Through the vast expanse of time and space,
Their love lives on, an eternal embrace.

12.Work is such a big part of our lives. And stress is a part of life. But when workplace stress reaches beyond normal levels and becomes unhealthy, we need to do something about it. Actually, rather than just reacting to the crisis du jour, we need to think about actively protecting our mental health at work every day before crises develop.
70% of employees are concerned about workplace stress and psychological safety at work. Only 23% of workers in Canada would feel comfortable talking to their employer about a psychological health issue.
I remember when, many years ago, I was in a work situation where almost everything was stacked against me: a crushing workload, an unsupportive boss, a competitive and toxic environment, and almost impossible chances of delivering on the objectives. At the time, the answer seemed to work harder and log more hours to perform in the role successfully. Big mistake. I was focused on achieving success. I couldn’t see that how I chose to deal with the situation would lead me into serious difficulties.
From the above info "70% of employees are concerned about workplace stress and psychological safety at work. Only 23% of workers in Canada would feel comfortable talking to their employer about a psychological health issue." tell the name of research paper where this data is published and its year. Give me the english meaning of "crisis du jour".

13.Striving to be "better" acknowledges the fact that there is always room for improvement. The quest to be better is a journey rather than a destination. It is an ongoing process that requires constant self-reflection, growth, and change. The beauty of striving to be better is that there is always something to work on, whether it be a personal or professional aspect of life. By focusing on being better, individuals and companies can adapt to changing circumstances and remain relevant and meaningful in a constantly evolving world.
In the corporate world, companies that focus on being the best often fall into the trap of complacency. They become so fixated on maintaining their position as the best that they fail to adapt to changing market trends and consumer preferences. In contrast, companies that focus on being better are always looking for ways to improve and innovate. They are willing to take risks and embrace change, which allows them to stay ahead of the curve.
One example of a company that focuses on being better rather than the best is Amazon. Amazon started as an online bookstore but has since grown into one of the largest retailers in the world. However, Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, has always emphasized the importance of being customer-centric and continuously improving the customer experience. This focus on being better has allowed Amazon to stay relevant and meaningful in a constantly changing retail landscape.
Another example of the importance of being better is in the field of athletics. Athletes who focus solely on being the best often suffer from burnout and injury. In contrast, athletes who focus on being better are more likely to have sustainable success. They understand that there is always room for improvement and that the quest for perfection is a never-ending journey. By focusing on being better, athletes can make incremental improvements that can add up over time.
The same concept applies to personal growth and development. Individuals who focus on being the best often fall into the trap of comparing themselves to others. They become fixated on external validation and lose sight of their personal goals and values. In contrast, individuals who focus on being better are more likely to have a growth mindset. They understand that failure and setbacks are opportunities for learning and growth. By focusing on being better, individuals can develop the skills and qualities necessary to lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.
The distinction between being the best and being better is not just a matter of semantics. It is a fundamental shift in mindset that can have a significant impact on personal and professional success.

16.Michelle Clifford was thinking about Charlotte Cox again. Charlotte was an articulate doctor with wobbly fingers and skinny toes. He walked over to the window and reflected on her wild surroundings. She had always loved chilly Paris with its jolly, jittery jungle. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel unstable. Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the an articulate figure of Charlotte Cox. Michelle gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a cute, clumsy, brandy drinker with slimy fingers and skinny toes. Her friends saw her as a helpful, high-pitched hero. Once, she had even helped a putrid injured bird cross the road.
But not even a cute person who had once helped a putrid injured bird cross the road, was prepared for what Charlotte had in store today. The rain hammered like partying foxes, making Michelle stressed. Michelle grabbed a magic hat that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.
As Michelle stepped outside and Charlotte came closer, she could see the shivering smile on her face. Charlotte gazed with the affection of 6597 loving blue-eyed blue bottles. She said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want peace."
Michelle looked back, even more stressed and still fingering the magic hat. "Charlotte, let's move in together," she replied.
They looked at each other with healthy feelings, like two miniature, magnificent mice loving at a very peculiar birthday party, which had jazz music playing in the background and two deranged uncles rampaging to the beat.
Michelle regarded Charlotte's wobbly fingers and skinny toes. "I feel the same way!" revealed Michelle with a delighted grin.
Charlotte looked jumpy, her emotions blushing like a knowledgeable, kaleidoscopic knife.
Then Charlotte came inside for a nice glass of brandy.

The next day, that never came. If only you hadn’t looked back. But you had. 
Turning just for a moment, you had glanced back toward the treeline. Seen the fingers of their branches clawing up toward the sky and beside them, the figure. 
At first you’d thought you must be mistaken, that your eyes in the hazy blur of twilight were playing tricks on you, but no. When you looked again ‘he’ was still there. Taller than any man could be, thinner even the willowy branches that extended ever upward from the trees. He loomed in the distance, like the shadow of some horrible dark truth and you knew instantly that you had to look away, that if you didn’t tear your eyes from that blank featureless face then soon the blank would wash over you, become you and you would walk slowly but surely, as if pulled by some magnetic force toward him, toward him though you feared him, though you were scared of his unnatural height, the aching blank whiteness of his face, the arms that seemed to stretch towards you and the slithering tentacles behind. 
Who is "he" in this sentence "When you looked again he was still there"? What is the meaning of "magnetic force" in the 3rd last line.

24.In this article, we carry out an empirical analysis of employing a novel model rooted in the principles of statistical physics for limit order book. We do so by predicting perhaps the most important measures in financial markets, that of price volatility and changes. This study distinguishes itself with three significant contributions. Implication on asset pricing. First, we establish novel benchmarks for the predictive accuracy of cryptocurrency asset price volatility and expected return utilising Level 3 order book data. The accuracy of our model is justified by high predictive R-squared values and prediction accuracy compared to previous literature, illustrating its robustness across different market conditions. Our model bypasses the need for training samples or parameter fitting since it takes full advantage of the market microstructure information inherently enclosed in the Level 3 order book data. Challet and Stinchcombe (2003), Eisler et al. (2012) and Cont et al. (2014) studied the price impact of market order submissions, and limit order submissions and cancellations that contained in the Level 3 order book data, and discussed how these action might affect the limit order book (LOB). This information is adequate for estimating the impact of both current and forthcoming orders on the order book dynamics and, subsequently, price dynamics. We underline significant economic implications for investors leveraging these predictive measures, which display a considerable edge over conventional techniques such as the Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading (VPIN) and the Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) when predicting volatility and expected asset returns. Volatility and return prediction carry tangible economic significance. The principal objective of asset pricing revolves around comprehending the patterns of expected return and its accompanying volatility, as posited by French et al. (1987). Even if expected returns were observed completely, the requirement for theories elucidating their behaviour still persists and the same for the empirical analysis validating them. However, the tasks of measuring volatility and return are well-known intricate: at a lower frequency time scale (like hourly or daily), return variations are primarily influenced by unpredictable news events that impact prices. Upon examination of identical datasets, distinct volatility estimators can manifest disparate characteristics. Notably, according to Cont et al. (2014), these estimators exhibit varied intra-day patterns in different underlying assets. On the other hand, at high-frequency trading scales, they are shadowed by the market microstructure noise generated by market participants, including market makers, informed traders, and noise traders. Cont et al. (2014) proved that the order book depth deeper than best bid and best ask contain information relevant to the price dynamics. Based on this empirical finding, a recent strand of literature attempted machine learning methods to capture the volatility and expected return of assets. Doering et al. (2017) developed convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict price and its volatility. Kercheval and Zhang (2015) employed Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the order book data. Sirignano (2019) and Sirignano and Cont (2019) developed a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to study the snapshot data of the order book. However, due to the restriction of computing power and model complexity of machine learning models, they are not feasible to study the information in deeper depths of the order book. Our proposed physics-based model defines the concept of Active Depth to distinguish the order book depths relevant with a simplicity in model complexity. The model interpretability is another shortcoming of the machine learning methods labeled as ‘black boxes’ because of the difficulty to understand the precise reasoning behind them, while the physics-based model provides a straightforward intuition to explain the order book dynamics by modelling it as a physical system. Market microstructure noise is another important topic to consider as it captures various of frictions intrinsic to the trading process. As argued by Ait-Sahalia and Yu (2008), these noises include the bid-ask bounces, discreteness of price fluctuations, differences in trade sizes, the informational content of price changes, strategies of the order flow, and inventory management effects. Eliminating the impact of these noises during investigating the asset price is meaningful for the asset pricing practices, particularly in the high-frequency trading markets. We provide a novel technique to model the order book dynamics that is possible to bypass hence eliminate the impact of both market news and market microstructure noises as they arise from the time series of asset price, volume, bid-ask spread or any other explanatory variables generated by order book dynamics. As a result, our research acts as a foundation upon which future studies can be built, moving the field towards a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that dominate asset pricing and, by extension, the broader financial market dynamics. A physical model on limit order book. Second, we incorporate the empirical asset pricing field with the physical models, which offers a unique perspective on market dynamics. While asset pricing traditionally focuses on determining the intrinsic value of assets, an understanding of the market microstructure – the system through which the trading of assets takes place – is crucial to comprehend how the supply and demand for assets are matched and how prices are ultimately discovered. Bouchaud et al. (2002) along with Potters and Bouchaud (2003) elucidated the statistical intricacies inherent to the order book. These empirical investigations served as the foundation of ’zero-intelligence’ models. Such models posited that the ’stylized facts’ are an emergent outcome of order flow properties and the intrinsic structure of the order book, without the need for the ’rationality’ assumptions. In their studies on limit order book, Bouchaud et al. (2002) and Potters and December 5, 2023 DRAFT Bouchaud (2003) offered a systematic exploration of empirical properties, and developed models based on statistical physics that linked the financial markets with physical systems. The increasing interest in applying physical models to finance, both in academia and in the industry, has yielded empirical studies in the field of asset pricing and the field of Econophysics. Bouchaud et al. (2003) examined the complex interplay between order flow and price fluctuations, drawing analogies with the external stimuli in physical systems. Their insights unveiled the market ‘randomness’. Farmer and Lillo (2004) through rigorous analysis, highlighted a connection between power-law tails in price changes and order flow dynamics, aligning with phenomena observed in physics. Farmer et al. (2006) explored the effects of supply-demand on price movements, contrasting with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Their findings drew parallels with long-range correlations in physical systems. Borland (2012) looked into the statistical pattern during market panics, by harnessing the concept of self-organizing systems from physics. Inspired from these studies in Econophysics, our analysis aim to provide a detailed investigation of the utility of a physical model applied to the challenging problems of modelling the LOB.

27.Civil services aspirants who lost their last UPSC attempt due to Covid-19 pandemic protested for extra UPSC attempts. They asserted that they would put pressure on the government for fulfillment of their demands. For this purpose, they started a campaign for extra UPSC attempts through several social media platforms such as Facebook and twitter. Social media is working as the people’s voice. It makes people's voices loud and clear.
Social media is the most promising medium in human history from the Stone Age to the Metal Age is currently in the Digital age. Mass mobilization to the spread of false news is highly influenced by the news available on social media. In a few cases, the situation deteriorated, which ultimately culminated in the loss of life.
In response to a recent exchange of aggressive religious social media remarks, two people beheaded a 40-year-old man in broad daylight at his tailoring store in a market in Rajasthan's Udaipur city. This incidence basically reveals that human beings are becoming inhuman day by day and have no guilt of being involved in anti-social activity.
Social media usage, on the other hand, can have a detrimental impact on youngsters by distracting them, interrupting their sleep, and exposing them to bullying, rumor spreading, inaccurate views of other people's lives, and peer pressure.
The views on social media held by peoples of 90’s and the younger generations are different. The younger generation see them as a way of life; however, people from the 90’s simply view them as a way to switch things up and meet with close friends sometimes. Social media has a big impact on people's everyday lives, self-esteem, daily activities, and even, to a considerable extent, job decisions. Younger generations' brains have been influenced by social media in such a manner that being successful YouTubers, Tik-Tokers, and Instagram influencers seems to be the aspiration of many of them. They take satisfaction in choosing to become these because of their cheap popularity and quick recognition.

32.Starting after the 1974 test, rates of cancer and genetic abnormalities, birth defects or developmental delays, began to climb. In this region of Pokhran, it seems that nearly every family has a story of a loved one suddenly lost to cancer. Following ‘Smiling Buddha’, land and homes were destroyed, crops turned white, skin and eye irritation began, and soon diseases struck. The same occurred, but on a larger scale in 1998. The effects of radiation have compounded over decades in the villages because groundwater was contaminated. Residents ingest radiation from both the 1974 and 1998 tests and genetic mutations are passed through generations. A village leader in Khetolei estimated that 56 people had died of cancer every year since 1998. The population is only about 3,000 people. The cancer mortality rate seems to be four times the national average. Children seem to be particularly at risk. Rates of childhood cancer and mortality seem to be increasing. Birth defects and genetic abnormalities, even in children born years after the tests, are common. There are many children who have never learned to walk or speak. High rates of breast cancer have also been reported. Unfortunately, this is to be expected: ionizing radiation, which is released in a nuclear explosion, disproportionately affects rapidly growing and dividing cells, which are generally found in women and children. Despite nuclear weapons testing’s obvious health effects, the Indian government only provided compensation for land damaged immediately after the test. Multiple small-scale studies have confirmed that there is a dangerous health phenomenon near Pokhran. But there has been no government-accepted investigation and the villages must rely on their own estimates of cancer deaths and other illnesses. With no formal study, it is hard for residents to demand assistance because they cannot explicitly point to the nuclear weapons tests as the cause.

The global consequences of “limited and regional” problems
Underground nuclear tests, like India’s, were argued to be a safer alternative than atmospheric or underwater tests. That’s why the Partial Test Ban Treaty, adopted in 1963 by the US and the Soviet Union, banned all nuclear tests, except for those performed underground. One look at Pokhran and it’s obvious this is wrong. Even if no one sees the mushroom clouds, underground tests can still have the same devastating health effects as atmospheric tests. The ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan is often perceived to be a ‘regional threat’. But a so-called “limited” nuclear war still has catastrophic effects -- and those are rarely recognized when political action is taken in Kashmir and nuclear war is threatened. A limited war still destroys cities, kills thousands, and injures hundreds of thousands more. Furthermore, it would have environmental effects that would harm global agriculture, trigger famine, and place close to two billion people worldwide at the brink of starvation. The environment and communities near Pokhran have suffered without recognition or care. And the current political environment places them at risk again. The 1998 tests were ordered when the current political party was last in power. The recent changed political status of Kashmir has dramatically increased tensions with Pakistan and in Kashmir. India and Pakistan have gone to war three times before and it is civilians and Kashmiris who suffer the most. Now there is talk of war again, this time with mentions of nuclear weapons. This creates a scenario where the legacy of India’s nuclear tests reaches far beyond Pokhran and creates a global humanitarian catastrophe. Check this out for photos of Pokhran residents, that speak a thousand words about the impact of nuclear testing.

Technology is an indispensable part of human life. The process and consequences of self-discovery is highly impacted by technology. Technology now plays an important role in moulding our ideas and lifestyles. We don't need to go to considerable extents to acquire answers to our questions. We can look it up on the internet. Assume a youngster has a question about how he should behave during an interview and wants to learn the answer. Instead of studying ideas, he prefers to use the internet and perform a Google search. There is no question that technology has made life simpler because there is an abundance of knowledge and information available on the internet. There is a fine line between the internet being a blessing and an imprecation. However, the amount to which it is a blessing is determined by how we restrict its interference in our lives and progress. Information improves our lives, but the act of getting that knowledge is also crucial for human growth.

41.The Belle experiment ran at the KEKB e +e − asymmetric energy collider at the KEK Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan between 1999 to 2010[13–15] . A large part of data samples at Belle were recorded on or near the Υ(4S) resonance, where copious BB¯ pairs used to study the B physics are produced. In addition, Belle collected a series of special data sets at Υ(1S), Υ(2S), and Υ(10860) resonances. The data samples recorded at Belle are detailed in Table 1 [16] . The total integrated luminosity reaches approximately 1 ab−1 . All of the data sets were used to explore the hadron spectroscopy, and a large number of new conventional quarkonia and some exotic hadrons were found using these samples.
Belle is constantly enriching the hadron spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1 [17] , many quarkonium(-like) states were observed at Belle, including long-term missing conventional quarkonia and new exotic hadrons of X, Y , Zc, and Zb states. In the following, we introduce three outstanding achievements on exotic hadrons at Belle.
In 2003, Belle observed a narrow charmonium-like state decaying into π +π −J/ψ with a mass of (3872.0±0.8) MeV/c 2 in B ± → K±π +π −J/ψ[5] . This is the first state with unconventional charmonium properties, thus opening a new era for studying of exotic hadrons. The X(3872) was subsequently confirmed by several other experiments [18–20] . The J P C = 1++ was determined by LHCb by performing a five-dimensional angular correlation analysis in B decays [21] . So far X(3872) is still one of the most interesting exotic meson candidates because of its unexpected properties as follows. The mass of X(3872) is close to the DD¯(∗) threshold, and its width is very narrow. Such property is very different from the excited ψ states, such as ψ(3770), ψ(4040), and ψ(4160), which decays into D (∗)D¯(∗) with large branching fractions, but their widths are very large. The enhancement of isospin-violating J/ψρ decay was observed. Very recently, Belle determined that the lower limit on the DD¯ ∗ coupling constant is 0.094 at 90% credibility level, which implies the partial width of DD¯ ∗ in X(3872) decays is much larger than those of J/ψρ, J/ψω, and radiative decay modes [22] . Searching for charged charmonium-like states is one of the most promising ways in studying exotic hadrons, since such a state must contain at least four quarks and thus cannot be a conventional quark-antiquark meson. The first charged charmonium-like state, Zc(4430)±, was reported in the π ±ψ(2S) mass spectrum in B → Kπ±ψ(2S) decays at Belle in 2007[8] . It was not confirmed by LHCb until seven years later [9] . Unlike Zc(4430)±, Zc(3900) state decaying into π ±J/ψ was observed simultaneously by BESIII and Belle [10,11] . The Zc(4200)+ → π +J/ψ with J P = 1+ was observed by performing an amplitude analysis of B¯0 → J/ψK−π + decays in four dimensions by Belle [23] , which has been confirmed by LHCb[24] . In comparison with the number of charmonium-like states from PDG[6] , the number of bottomonium-like states is smaller due to lower production rates and limited experimental conditions. Up to now, only two bottomonium-like states were observed: Zb(10610) and Zb(10650). They were discovered by Belle only using Υ(5S) on-resonance and scan data samples [12,25–28] . The Zb(10610)+ and Zb(10650)+ can decay into π +Υ(nS) (n = 1, 2, 3), π +hb(mP) (m = 1, 2), and B (∗)+B¯∗0 [12,25–27] . The decay modes of Zb(10610)+ → B +B¯∗0 and Zb(10650)+ → B ∗+B¯∗0 are dominant[27] . The neutral partner of the Zb(10610)+ was observed as well in its π 0Υ(2S) and π 0Υ(3S) decay modes [28] .

Light pseudoscalars that couple to Higgs bosons appear in many well-motivated new physics scenarios. A few examples of such scenarios are the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model [1], axion models [2, 3], and models with dark or extended Higgs sectors [4–6]. In addition, they may be related to a possible muon 𝑔 − 2 deviation with respect to the Standard Model (SM) predicted value, e.g. as in Ref. [7]. The search for elusive particles in the decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson [8, 9] is a highly promising avenue for their discovery. Due to the narrow decay width of the Higgs boson [10], even minor contributions from physics beyond the SM can result in final states with significant branching fractions. The most recent combination of the ATLAS measurements of the Higgs boson production rates does not rule out decays to yet unobserved states with a branching ratio of up to 12% [11] at 95% confidence level (CL). The corresponding result from the CMS experiment is 16% [12]. These results indicate that there may be sizeable exotic decays of the Higgs bosons that have not been observed yet. The LHC experiments have looked for such particles in Higgs boson decays, usually assuming that the Higgs boson, 𝐻, decays to a pair of narrow-width, pseudoscalar particles 𝑎 (𝐻 → 𝑎𝑎), which subsequently decay to fermions or photons. Such searches have been performed in the 𝑏𝑏𝜇𝜇 [13, 14], 4𝑏 [15, 16], 4𝜇 [17, 18], 𝜇𝜇𝜏𝜏 or 4𝜏 [19–24], 𝑏𝑏𝜏𝜏 [25], 4𝛾 [26, 27] and 2𝛾 + 2 jets [28] final states. In addition to the 𝐻 → 𝑎𝑎 channel, the decay mode of 𝐻 → 𝑍𝑎 is well-motivated, but remains less studied. Such decays are particularly motivated by axion models [2]. This decay has been searched for by ATLAS in the case where the 𝑍 boson decays to leptons and 𝑎 decays to jets [29], but this is one of the first searches for the 𝐻 → 𝑍𝑎 with 𝑎 → 𝛾𝛾. In this letter, results from the search for the final state in which the 𝑍 boson decays to leptons and the 𝑎 particle decays to a photon pair are presented using the full LHC Run 2 proton–proton (𝑝 𝑝) collision data collected by the ATLAS detector during 2015–2018 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb−1 . The search explores 𝑎 particle masses, 𝑚𝑎, between 0.1 GeV and 33 GeV. When the invariant mass of the two photons from the 𝑎 decay is below 2 GeV and the transverse momentum of the diphoton system is high, their electromagnetic showers typically overlap in the detector and a single photon is reconstructed. The search presented here considers both the merged and the resolved 𝑎 → 𝛾𝛾 decays. This letter is structured as follows. A description of the ATLAS detector is given in Section 2, followed by a presentation of the data and simulated samples in Section 3. The physics object reconstruction is discussed in Section 4, followed by an explanation of the analysis in Section 5, the presentation of the search results in Section 6 and the conclusion in Section 7.

44.Socialization is the lifetime process of acquiring and disseminating norms, conventions, and ideas. The use of social media has now become so important for the new generation that it has become an addiction that is difficult to recognize, so in this contrast, the older generation feels a sense of satisfaction and contentment at having been born in an era when something other than technology defined the social and recreational lives of the children of that time. We are attempting to become more socialized through media, yet the media is expanding, and individuals are essentially being trapped within a room. The younger generation is entirely relied on social media. Social media is basically the primary source of getting information in the present scenario while in the 90’s newspapers were the primary source of information. Reading the newspaper is a habit that our parents have instilled in us. The primary source of reliable news was regarded as newspapers and television news. Doordarshan was the most famous and reliable TV channel in the 90’s, compared to the 24-hour news networks of today, which lack any meaningful content and are occupied with playing outside in the real world. Social media is basically an outcome of technological advancements.

Every technological advancement brings advantages along with disappointments. It is on the awareness of the users how advantages can be maximized, and disadvantages minimized. 90’s is the time when there was no Internet and single-screen theaters were common. So, circumstances at that point were not conducive for the growth of social media. Rotary landline phones were found in every home feature, phones were considered a luxury, and our identity was determined by what we did in the real world. The 90’s generation often feel an awkward generation gap with younger generations. Social media created a virtual word which runs parallel to the real word. In contrast if we talk about socialization then there are two kinds of socialization that exist the one is real socialization and other is the virtual socialization. Technological innovation brought with itself the heat of change. A person who is able to adopt the stream of change will survive and advanced in future.

We molded ourself with change in time and time advanced with technology. We also adapted to ourself with changing technology and evolving social media life. Simple landline advanced in to cellular phones and it gives way to multimedia phones which ultimately culminated in to proliferation of smart phones. The origin of smart phones has given way to social media advancement.

Impact of social media we can observe in every sphere of life. Social media is used by the people for popularity. Ministers, Bureaucrats and several higher ranked government officials are proactively using social sites and social media to popularize their works and trying to establish themself as highly efficient professionals who are working more efficiently as an administrator to resolve the suffering of others. While the main purpose of using social media to popularize himself as an efficient administrator because it will be beneficial for them as per future is concern.

Billions of people are now creating and sharing massive amounts of data with one another. This gives people a sense of being associated instead of feeling lonely. When you consider developing a social media strategy for your company, the following platforms are likely to spring to mind: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube etc.

45.Rationality promotes scientific temperament in the individual. Scientific temperament enables people to raise the question of what exists in the universe. Scientific invention, discovery and exploration are all the outcome of human rationality. Rationalism is the very fundamental essence of humanity. When the light of rationality illuminates the human brain, intellectualism takes birth. The rise of rationalism is the renaissance which happened during the 14th to 17th century in Europe.
Following the Middle Ages, Europe had a passionate era of cultural, artistic, political, and economic "rebirth" during the Renaissance. The Renaissance, often seen as occurring between the 14th and the 17th centuries, fostered the rediscovery of ancient philosophy, literature, and art. The Renaissance was basically the rise of rationalism. Every intellectual perspective became more visible under the illumination of rationalism.
Article 51 A(h), of the Fundamental Duties (FDs) which was introduced in the Indian constitution in the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act,1976. It is the responsibility of every Indian citizen to develop scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform. The spirit of inquiry is basically promoting rationalism in human beings. If we want to know the reality of the universe or cosmos, then our approach should be rational. The truths about who we are, the world we live in, and the cosmos may be discovered if we think logically and rationally. Truth and reason go hand in hand. It is not possible to imagine one exist without the other.
Rationality is continually looking for reality, and reality can only be found in the light of rationality. The Indian legal system is based on the principle of rationality. Judges attempt to make judgements based on evidence rather than preconceived notions, emotions, and sentiments. Rationality serves as the standard by which reality is evaluated. Rationality is continually trying to give truth the upper hand and truth is real. Thus, what is rational is also real, and vice versa.
Rational people may attain their life objectives by having the ability to control their thoughts and conduct. They have the self-control to avoid engaging in unhealthy life habits such as drinking alcohol or disordered eating, and they are able to make rational judgments without letting their emotions affect them. A logical mind constantly thinks calmly, attentively, and objectively. It may be said that everyone with a rational mind has this as their ultimate goal. If you consistently participate in rational thinking, you can base your conclusions on facts and evidence. Using reason, you can recognize bad conceptions and practices.
We may better comprehend ourselves and those of others who surround us by using rational thought. It can also help us succeed since we can comprehend realities regarding true desires instead of becoming sidetracked or behaving unreasonably. Although full objectivity will never exist, logical thought is still possible. As far as objectivity is concerned, rationality encourages individuals to make informed decisions. Setting feasible micro and macro goals is the fundamental indicator of being rational, and one should be proud of one's capacity for logical thought. If you want to succeed, you must be rational.

It a decentralized ledger that allows unprecendented transparency and security. Blockchain, although it's still early in its development, already proven to be a game changer in varius industries.

The underlying concept behind the blokchain is simple yet powerfull. Each "block" in the chain contains data and a unique hash, linking it to the previous block. This chained structure ensures that data remain unaltered and secure. Furthermore, the decentralization eliminate the need to trust a central entity.

One of the most known use case of the blockchain is in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The blockchain enables secure and anonymous transactions without the intervention of third parties.

Despite its benefits, blockchain still facing challenges, such as scalability and widespread adoption. Nevertheless, the potential of blockchain to transform the way we manage information and conduct transactions is undeniable. Overtime, blockchain could be the backbone of the next digital revolution.







48.“The 13th Amendment was the first amendment to the United States Constitution during the period of Reconstruction. The amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865, and ended the argument about whether slavery was legal in the United States. The amendment reads, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.”

The 13th Amendment was necessary because the Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln in January of 1863, did not end slavery entirely; those ensllaved in border states had not been freed. The proclamation also did not address the issue of slavery in territories that would become states in the future. Lincoln and other leaders realized amending the Constitution was the only way to officially end slavery. The 13th Amendment forever abolished slavery as an institution in all U.S. states and territories.

In addition to banning slavery, the amendment outlawed the practice of involuntary servitude and peonage. Involuntary servitude or peonage occurs when a person is coerced to work in order to pay off debts. The 13th Amendment exempts from the involuntary servitude clause persons convicted of a crime, and persons drafted to serve in the military.

The 13th Amendment to the Constitution did not end discrimination against those who had been enslaved and blacks. However, it ended slavery and began the long-term goal of achieving equality for all Americans.”

A choice is the act of selecting something from a range of possibilities or is one of your options. Choice may also mean that something has been carefully chosen. Existence of choices does not mean that all choices are legally right or socially acceptable. Existence of choices does not assure your righteousness. If something has been asked to do it does not mean that it is right. If something was done according to the wishes of others, then it cannot be claimed that you are not guilty because someone else has asked to do so. Concerns related to right or wrong are independent of virtue or wishes. Something is absolute in this world and no negotiation is possible regarding such kinds of things. Moving from one choice to other choices is your discretion but its righteousness or wrongness sometimes depends on your act. It means the choice is neutral. You have to prove that the choice you made is right. In some other circumstances the right or wrong is predetermined i.e., it is absolute, and you cannot negotiate it. The restored gospel of Jesus Christ provides a cohesive response to the claims of righteousness and wrong. The fundamental idea that promotes harmony and joy is generally considered as the path of righteousness.

54.1. Tarakeswar Case (1874)
The popularity of the case is understandable from the fact that authorities had to sell tickets at the entry. The case revolves around Nobin Chandra and his wife Elokeshi. Nobin slit his wife’s throat for allegedly having an affair with the chief priest of Tarakeshwar Temple. Nobin confessed his crime to the police, but the locals were mostly on his side. Due to this, Nobin was released after two years while serving life imprisonment. However, the priest was put behind the bars for three years. In fact, there were rumours doing rounds that the priest had raped Elokeshi by promising to help her with “fertility issues”. This case was even more important due to the ‘British Raj’ prevalent during that time.
2. Bhawal Case (1921-1946)
One of the most peculiar identity cases of that time, it revolves around a possible pretender who affirmed to be the prince of Bhawal Estate, largest zamindari estate of Bengal.
Ramendra, a kumar of Bhawal estate died in early 1900, but there was tittle-tattle among people that he was not really dead. In 1921, a religious man who looked like Ramendra was spotted in Dhaka. The former tenants and farmers of Ramendra supported his claim to the title. The entire village trusted him except Ramendra’s widow, Bibhabati. After a long legal procedure of 25 years, the court ruled in his favor after which he passed away due to a stroke.
The interesting thing is that during the case, the look-alike (or whatever) also moved to Calcutta and even collected 1/3rd of the estate revenue.
3. Kiranjit Ahluwalia’s Case
Kiranjit Ahluwalia’s case came a year after marital rape was declared as ‘rape’ in 1991. She was convicted of murder by burning her husband alive during his sleep. The lady in question had been a victim of domestic violence for over a decade and had been in severe depression when she took the step. The case set a benchmark for improving public awareness on domestic abuse. As a final verdict, she was convicted to life imprisonment. However, she was later freed as her conviction of murder was reduced to manslaughter.
5. Mathura Rape Case (1972)
One of the most prominent cases in the history of India, mainly due to the protests following the final verdict which saw a major overhaul in the rape laws of the country. In the city of Mathura, a tribal woman was raped by two constables within the premises of a police station. During the trial, the judge found the accused not guilty. Can you guess the reason given behind this unfair judgement? As per the judge, a sexual act within the premises of a police station was permitted and consensual. However, this law had to be amended due to the massive protests all over the country, with everyone saying- Submission does not mean consent.
These were some of the cases which are extremely interesting if you go through the entire judgement. Some cases would have surely made you go “Like what! Are you serious this ever happened?” This proves one thing- The lives of lawyers and judges aren’t as easy as it seems and you must be prepared before taking up the L.L.B. course. They may seem right to some and wrong to others. However, as history has it, wherever they have been wrong, they have acknowledged their mistakes, and the judgement has been changed as well. So, let them do their work while we do ours.

Once upon a time, in a desert far away, there was a rose who was so proud of her beautiful looks. Her only complaint was that she was growing next to an ugly cactus.

Every day, the beautiful rose would insult and mock the cactus about his looks, all while the cactus remained quiet. All the other plants nearby tried to make the rose see sense, but she was too swayed by her own looks.

One scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the plants. The rose quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color.

Looking to the cactus, she saw a sparrow dip his beak into the cactus to drink some water. Though ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some water. The kind cactus readily agreed, helping them both through the tough summer as friends.

In Jainism those who are laity or are normal house holders; they don’t have the commitment to pursue a life of want lessness; they have the pragmatic way out of leaving the things to those who have sacrificed their family, they are the like the Shramans of Buddhism. Buddha said the life of self-mortification is not normal. This is painful to the practitioner, this will not inspire people to come to this fold, this self- denying life might be apparently attractive but in reality, this may dispel to follow this very religion. On the other hand, Buddha said people are unhappy because there is no end to their desire. Desires must be controlled. Neither the life of desires nor the life of mortification is natural so, a middle path is to be followed. This would be life of right thinking, a life of right action, right view or the positive attitude to look at things, positive lively hood, right effort, right mindfulness, right speech and right action. Not only in precepts but even in practice Buddhism has been a pragmatic approach to life. Buddhism did not make people pacifist as is very often perceived. Ashoka left wars but he never dismantled his army. Buddhism because of its middle path or pragmatism, even the non-deification of its theology could not prevent it from becoming a world religion. Buddhism not only crossed the borders of India but became a world religion, the whole of West Asia, Far East and even South East Asia became Buddhism. In all sides of India; Buddhism was the major religion. So, we socially closed our borders and said crossing the oceans is a great sin. The want lessness is too good to follow; materialism is a blind alley, so, what is the way out Jainism to an extent prescribes want lessness. It is based on self-mortification and self-denial but it remained popular for a long time. Materialism is crass and denies humanism. There are ways to avoid both. The way is Buddhism or to follow the middle path. One need not be in a self-denying mode nor in a mode of get everything. The way out is to follow a humanitarian way. A way where Gandhi can smile with his notion of humanity has everything for its need but not fo its greed.

A farmer needed a water source for his farm, so he bought a well from his neighbor. However, The neighbor was cunning. The next day, as the farmer came to draw water from his well, the neighbor refused to let him take any.

When the farmer asked why, the neighbor replied, “I sold you the well, not the water,” and walked away. Distraught, the farmer went to the emperor to ask for justice. He explained what had happened.

The emperor called on Birbal, the wisest of his nine courtiers. Birbal proceeded to question the neighbor, “Why don’t you let the farmer take water from the well? You sold the well to the farmer, did you not?”

The neighbor replied, “Birbal, I did sell the well to the farmer but not the water within it. He has no right to draw water from the well.”

Birbal said, “Look, since you sold the well, you have no right to keep the water in the farmer’s well. Either you pay rent to the farmer or take it out immediately.” Realizing that his scheme had failed, the neighbor apologized and went home.

61.The laws of thermodynamics are fundamental principles that govern the behavior of energy and matter in the universe. There are four laws, but the first three are the most commonly discussed and well-known. Let's go through each of them:
1. Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics:
If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This law establishes the concept of temperature and is the basis for temperature measurement.
2. First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Energy Conservation):
The total energy of an isolated system is constant. Energy can be transformed from one form to another (e.g., from heat to work), but it cannot be created or destroyed. Mathematically, it is often expressed as:
Δ�=�−�ΔU=Q−W
Where:
Δ�ΔU is the change in internal energy of the system.
�Q is the heat added to the system.
�W is the work done by the system.
3. Second Law of Thermodynamics:
a. Clausius Statement:
Heat energy will not naturally flow from a colder body to a hotter body. In other words, heat tends to flow from hot to cold.
b. Kelvin-Planck Statement:
It is impossible to construct a device that operates in a cycle and produces no effect other than the transfer of heat from a lower-temperature body to a higher-temperature body. This statement highlights the impossibility of a perpetual motion machine.
4. Third Law of Thermodynamics:
As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero (0 K0K), the entropy of the system approaches a minimum. The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is exactly zero. This law is often stated as "the entropy of a perfect crystal is zero at absolute zero."

Police in Mumbai's Bhayander area have arrested five men for selling spurious butter by packaging it as Amul butter. According to reports, a team led by Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Atul Kulkarni made the arrests after busting the gang's hideout at Bhayander Road under the limits of the Kashimira Road police station. Pictures accessed by sections of the media show adulterated butter being filled into Amul packaging. At the time of the raid, police seized a staggering 1,000 kilograms of butter along with packaging used by Amul Butter. An investigation has been launched into the case to ascertain how members of the gang got their hands on the packaging used by Amul cooperation. The process of adding unwanted substances to food in a bid to increase profits is known as adulteration. While it is a common practice across the country, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) keeps a tight check on adulterated products infiltrating the market. Milk, tea, coffee, vegetables, dairy products along with wheat and other food grains are the most commonly adulterated products in India as per a report by the Annual Public Laboratory Testing. Food inspectors with the municipal corporation in Gujarat's Surat city busted a gang of miscreants who were allegedly mixing adulterated ingredients to butter and ghee before selling it off as pure to residents in Katargam and Varachh. During the raid which was conducted on December 12, officials seized 25 kg of loose butter and 15 kg of vanaspati ghee from one of the locations while recovering 12 ghee tins of 15 kg each and 48 packs of butter of 1 kg each from the gang's second hideout.

67.Ancient Egypt, civilization in northeastern Africa that dates from the 4th millennium BCE. Its many achievements, preserved in its art and monuments, hold a fascination that continues to grow as archaeological finds expose its secrets. This article focuses on Egypt from its prehistory through its unification under Menes (Narmer) in the 3rd millennium BCE—sometimes used as a reference point for Egypt’s origin—and up to the Islamic conquest in the 7th century CE. For subsequent history through the contemporary period, see Egypt.

Introduction to ancient Egyptian civilization
Life in ancient Egypt
Ancient Egypt can be thought of as an oasis in the desert of northeastern Africa, dependent on the annual inundation of the Nile River to support its agricultural population. The country’s chief wealth came from the fertile floodplain of the Nile valley, where the river flows between bands of limestone hills, and the Nile delta, in which it fans into several branches north of present-day Cairo. Between the floodplain and the hills is a variable band of low desert that supported a certain amount of game. The Nile was Egypt’s sole transportation artery.

The First Cataract at Aswān, where the riverbed is turned into rapids by a belt of granite, was the country’s only well-defined boundary within a populated area. To the south lay the far less hospitable area of Nubia, in which the river flowed through low sandstone hills that in most regions left only a very narrow strip of cultivable land. Nubia was significant for Egypt’s periodic southward expansion and for access to products from farther south. West of the Nile was the arid Sahara, broken by a chain of oases some 125 to 185 miles (200 to 300 km) from the river and lacking in all other resources except for a few minerals. The eastern desert, between the Nile and the Red Sea, was more important, for it supported a small nomadic population and desert game, contained numerous mineral deposits, including gold, and was the route to the Red Sea.

To the northeast was the Isthmus of Suez. It offered the principal route for contact with Sinai, from which came turquoise and possibly copper, and with southwestern Asia, Egypt’s most important area of cultural interaction, from which were received stimuli for technical development and cultivars for crops. Immigrants and ultimately invaders crossed the isthmus into Egypt, attracted by the country’s stability and prosperity. From the late 2nd millennium BCE onward, numerous attacks were made by land and sea along the eastern Mediterranean coast.

At first, relatively little cultural contact came by way of the Mediterranean Sea, but from an early date Egypt maintained trading relations with the Lebanese port of Byblos (present-day Jbail). Egypt needed few imports to maintain basic standards of living, but good timber was essential and not available within the country, so it usually was obtained from Lebanon. Minerals such as obsidian and lapis lazuli were imported from as far afield as Anatolia and Afghanistan.

Agriculture centred on the cultivation of cereal crops, chiefly emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). The fertility of the land and general predictability of the inundation ensured very high productivity from a single annual crop. This productivity made it possible to store large surpluses against crop failures and also formed the chief basis of Egyptian wealth, which was, until the creation of the large empires of the 1st millennium BCE, the greatest of any state in the ancient Middle East.

Basin irrigation was achieved by simple means, and multiple cropping was not feasible until much later times, except perhaps in the lakeside area of Al-Fayyūm. As the river deposited alluvial silt, raising the level of the floodplain, and land was reclaimed from marsh, the area available for cultivation in the Nile valley and delta increased, while pastoralism declined slowly. In addition to grain crops, fruit and vegetables were important, the latter being irrigated year-round in small plots. Fish was also vital to the diet. Papyrus, which grew abundantly in marshes, was gathered wild and in later times was cultivated. It may have been used as a food crop, and it certainly was used to make rope, matting, and sandals. Above all, it provided the characteristic Egyptian writing material, which, with cereals, was the country’s chief export in Late period Egyptian and then Greco-Roman times.

Cattle may have been domesticated in northeastern Africa. The Egyptians kept many as draft animals and for their various products, showing some of the interest in breeds and individuals that is found to this day in the Sudan and eastern Africa. The donkey, which was the principal transport animal (the camel did not become common until Roman times), was probably domesticated in the region. The native Egyptian breed of sheep became extinct in the 2nd millennium BCE and was replaced by an Asiatic breed. Sheep were primarily a source of meat; their wool was rarely used. Goats were more numerous than sheep. Pigs were also raised and eaten. Ducks and geese were kept for food, and many of the vast numbers of wild and migratory birds found in Egypt were hunted and trapped. Desert game, principally various species of antelope and ibex, were hunted by the elite; it was a royal privilege to hunt lions and wild cattle. Pets included dogs, which were also used for hunting, cats, and monkeys. In addition, the Egyptians had a great interest in, and knowledge of, most species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish in their environment.

Most Egyptians were probably descended from settlers who moved to the Nile valley in prehistoric times, with population increase coming through natural fertility. In various periods there were immigrants from Nubia, Libya, and especially the Middle East. They were historically significant and also may have contributed to population growth, but their numbers are unknown. Most people lived in villages and towns in the Nile valley and delta. Dwellings were normally built of mud brick and have long since disappeared beneath the rising water table or beneath modern town sites, thereby obliterating evidence for settlement patterns. In antiquity, as now, the most favoured location of settlements was on slightly raised ground near the riverbank, where transport and water were easily available and flooding was unlikely. Until the 1st millennium BCE, Egypt was not urbanized to the same extent as Mesopotamia. Instead, a few centres, notably Memphis and Thebes, attracted population and particularly the elite, while the rest of the people were relatively evenly spread over the land. The size of the population has been estimated as having risen from 1 to 1.5 million in the 3rd millennium BCE to perhaps twice that number in the late 2nd millennium and 1st millennium BCE. (Much higher levels of population were reached in Greco-Roman times.)

Nearly all of the people were engaged in agriculture and were probably tied to the land. In theory all the land belonged to the king, although in practice those living on it could not easily be removed and some categories of land could be bought and sold. Land was assigned to high officials to provide them with an income, and most tracts required payment of substantial dues to the state, which had a strong interest in keeping the land in agricultural use. Abandoned land was taken back into state ownership and reassigned for cultivation. The people who lived on and worked the land were not free to leave and were obliged to work it, but they were not slaves; most paid a proportion of their produce to major officials. Free citizens who worked the land on their own behalf did emerge; terms applied to them tended originally to refer to poor people, but these agriculturalists were probably not poor. Slavery was never common, being restricted to captives and foreigners or to people who were forced by poverty or debt to sell themselves into service. Slaves sometimes even married members of their owners’ families, so that in the long term those belonging to households tended to be assimilated into free society. In the New Kingdom (from about 1539 to 1075 BCE), large numbers of captive slaves were acquired by major state institutions or incorporated into the army. Punitive treatment of foreign slaves or of native fugitives from their obligations included forced labour, exile (in, for example, the oases of the western desert), or compulsory enlistment in dangerous mining expeditions. Even nonpunitive employment such as quarrying in the desert was hazardous. The official record of one expedition shows a mortality rate of more than 10 percent.

Just as the Egyptians optimized agricultural production with simple means, their crafts and techniques, many of which originally came from Asia, were raised to extraordinary levels of perfection. The Egyptians’ most striking technical achievement, massive stone building, also exploited the potential of a centralized state to mobilize a huge labour force, which was made available by efficient agricultural practices. Some of the technical and organizational skills involved were remarkable. The construction of the great pyramids of the 4th dynasty (c. 2575–c. 2465 BCE) has yet to be fully explained and would be a major challenge to this day. This expenditure of skill contrasts with sparse evidence of an essentially neolithic way of living for the rural population of the time, while the use of flint tools persisted even in urban environments at least until the late 2nd millennium BCE. Metal was correspondingly scarce, much of it being used for prestige rather than everyday purposes.

In urban and elite contexts, the Egyptian ideal was the nuclear family, but, on the land and even within the central ruling group, there is evidence for extended families. Egyptians were monogamous, and the choice of partners in marriage, for which no formal ceremony or legal sanction is known, did not follow a set pattern. Consanguineous marriage was not practiced during the Dynastic period, except for the occasional marriage of a brother and sister within the royal family, and that practice may have been open only to kings or heirs to the throne. Divorce was in theory easy, but it was costly. Women had a legal status only marginally inferior to that of men. They could own and dispose of property in their own right, and they could initiate divorce and other legal proceedings. They hardly ever held administrative office but increasingly were involved in religious cults as priestesses or “chantresses.” Married women held the title “mistress of the house,” the precise significance of which is unknown. Lower down the social scale, they probably worked on the land as well as in the house.

The uneven distribution of wealth, labour, and technology was related to the only partly urban character of society, especially in the 3rd millennium BCE. The country’s resources were not fed into numerous provincial towns but instead were concentrated to great effect around the capital—itself a dispersed string of settlements rather than a city—and focused on the central figure in society, the king. In the 3rd and early 2nd millennia, the elite ideal, expressed in the decoration of private tombs, was manorial and rural. Not until much later did Egyptians develop a more pronouncedly urban character.

The king and ideology: administration, art, and writing
In cosmogonical terms, Egyptian society consisted of a descending hierarchy of the gods, the king, the blessed dead, and humanity (by which was understood chiefly the Egyptians). Of these groups, only the king was single, and hence he was individually more prominent than any of the others. A text that summarizes the king’s role states that he “is on earth for ever and ever, judging mankind and propitiating the gods, and setting order [maʿat, a central concept] in place of disorder. He gives offerings to the gods and mortuary offerings to the spirits [the blessed dead].” The king was imbued with divine essence, but not in any simple or unqualified sense. His divinity accrued to him from his office and was reaffirmed through rituals, but it was vastly inferior to that of major gods; he was god rather than man by virtue of his potential, which was immeasurably greater than that of any human being. To humanity, he manifested the gods on earth, a conception that was elaborated in a complex web of metaphor and doctrine; less directly, he represented humanity to the gods. The text quoted above also gives great prominence to the dead, who were the object of a cult for the living and who could intervene in human affairs; in many periods the chief visible expenditure and focus of display of nonroyal individuals, as of the king, was on provision for the tomb and the next world. Egyptian kings are commonly called pharaohs, following the usage of the Bible. The term pharaoh, however, is derived from the Egyptian per ʿaa (“great estate”) and dates to the designation of the royal palace as an institution. This term for palace was used increasingly from about 1400 BCE as a way of referring to the living king; in earlier times it was rare.

Rules of succession to the kingship are poorly understood. The common conception that the heir to the throne had to marry his predecessor’s oldest daughter has been disproved; kingship did not pass through the female line. The choice of queen seems to have been free; often the queen was a close relative of the king, but she also might be unrelated to him. In the New Kingdom, for which evidence is abundant, each king had a queen with distinctive titles, as well as a number of minor wives.

Sons of the chief queen seem to have been the preferred successors to the throne, but other sons could also become king. In many cases the successor was the eldest (surviving) son, and such a pattern of inheritance agrees with more general Egyptian values, but often he was some other relative or was completely unrelated. New Kingdom texts describe, after the event, how kings were appointed heirs either by their predecessors or by divine oracles, and such may have been the pattern when there was no clear successor. Dissent and conflict are suppressed from public sources. From the Late period (664–332 BCE), when sources are more diverse and patterns less rigid, numerous usurpations and interruptions to the succession are known; they probably had many forerunners.

The king’s position changed gradually from that of an absolute monarch at the centre of a small ruling group made up mostly of his kin to that of the head of a bureaucratic state—in which his rule was still absolute—based on officeholding and, in theory, on free competition and merit. By the 5th dynasty, fixed institutions had been added to the force of tradition and the regulation of personal contact as brakes on autocracy, but the charismatic and superhuman power of the king remained vital.

The elite of administrative officeholders received their positions and commissions from the king, whose general role as judge over humanity they put into effect. They commemorated their own justice and concern for others, especially their inferiors, and recorded their own exploits and ideal conduct of life in inscriptions for others to see. Thus, the position of the elite was affirmed by reference to the king, to their prestige among their peers, and to their conduct toward their subordinates, justifying to some extent the fact that they—and still more the king—appropriated much of the country’s production.

These attitudes and their potential dissemination through society counterbalanced inequality, but how far they were accepted cannot be known. The core group of wealthy officeholders numbered at most a few hundred, and the administrative class of minor officials and scribes, most of whom could not afford to leave memorials or inscriptions, perhaps 5,000. With their dependents, these two groups formed perhaps 5 percent of the early population. Monuments and inscriptions commemorated no more than one in a thousand people.

According to royal ideology, the king appointed the elite on the basis of merit, and in ancient conditions of high mortality the elite had to be open to recruits from outside. There was, however, also an ideal that a son should succeed his father. In periods of weak central control this principle predominated, and in the Late period the whole society became more rigid and stratified.

Writing was a major instrument in the centralization of the Egyptian state and its self-presentation. The two basic types of writing—hieroglyphs, which were used for monuments and display, and the cursive form known as hieratic—were invented at much the same time in late predynastic Egypt (c. 3000 BCE). Writing was chiefly used for administration, and until about 2650 BCE no continuous texts are preserved; the only extant literary texts written before the early Middle Kingdom (c. 1950 BCE) seem to have been lists of important traditional information and possibly medical treatises. The use and potential of writing were restricted both by the rate of literacy, which was probably well below 1 percent, and by expectations of what writing might do. Hieroglyphic writing was publicly identified with Egypt. Perhaps because of this association with a single powerful state, its language, and its culture, Egyptian writing was seldom adapted to write other languages; in this it contrasts with the cuneiform script of the relatively uncentralized, multilingual Mesopotamia. Nonetheless, Egyptian hieroglyphs probably served in the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE as the model from which the alphabet, ultimately the most widespread of all writing systems, evolved.
The dominant visible legacy of ancient Egypt is in works of architecture and representational art. Until the Middle Kingdom, most of these were mortuary: royal tomb complexes, including pyramids and mortuary temples, and private tombs. There were also temples dedicated to the cult of the gods throughout the country, but most of these were modest structures. From the beginning of the New Kingdom, temples of the gods became the principal monuments; royal palaces and private houses, which are very little known, were less important. Temples and tombs were ideally executed in stone with relief decoration on their walls and were filled with stone and wooden statuary, inscribed and decorated stelae (freestanding small stone monuments), and, in their inner areas, composite works of art in precious materials. The design of the monuments and their decoration dates in essence to the beginning of the historical period and presents an ideal, sanctified cosmos. Little in it is related to the everyday world, and, except in palaces, works of art may have been rare outside temples and tombs. Decoration may record real historical events, rituals, or the official titles and careers of individuals, but its prime significance is the more general assertion of values, and the information presented must be evaluated for its plausibility and compared with other evidence. Some of the events depicted in relief on royal monuments were certainly iconic rather than historically factual.

The highly distinctive Egyptian method of rendering nature and artistic style was also a creation of early times and can be seen in most works of Egyptian art. In content, these are hierarchically ordered so that the most important figures, the gods and the king, are shown together, while before the New Kingdom gods seldom occur in the same context as humanity. The decoration of a nonroyal tomb characteristically shows the tomb’s owner with his subordinates, who administer his land and present him with its produce. The tomb owner is also typically depicted hunting in the marshes, a favourite pastime of the elite that may additionally symbolize passage into the next world. The king and the gods are absent in nonroyal tombs, and, until the New Kingdom, overtly religious matter is restricted to rare scenes of mortuary rituals and journeys and to textual formulas. Temple reliefs, in which king and gods occur freely, show the king defeating his enemies, hunting, and especially offering to the gods, who in turn confer benefits upon him. Human beings are present at most as minor figures supporting the king. On both royal and nonroyal monuments, an ideal world is represented in which all are beautiful and everything goes well; only minor figures may have physical imperfections.

This artistic presentation of values originated at the same time as writing but before the latter could record continuous texts or complex statements. Some of the earliest continuous texts of the 4th and 5th dynasties show an awareness of an ideal past that the present could only aspire to emulate. A few “biographies” of officials allude to strife, but more-nuanced discussion occurs first in literary texts of the Middle Kingdom. The texts consist of stories, dialogues, lamentations, and especially instructions on how to live a good life, and they supply a rich commentary on the more one-dimensional rhetoric of public inscriptions. Literary works were written in all the main later phases of the Egyptian language—Middle Egyptian; the “classical” form of the Middle and New kingdoms, continuing in copies and inscriptions into Roman times; Late Egyptian, from the 19th dynasty to about 700 BCE; and the demotic script from the 4th century BCE to the 3rd century CE—but many of the finest and most complex are among the earliest.

Literary works also included treatises on mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and magic, as well as various religious texts and canonical lists that classified the categories of creation (probably the earliest genre, dating back to the beginning of the Old Kingdom, c. 2575 BCE, or even a little earlier). Among these texts, little is truly systematic, a notable exception being a medical treatise on wounds. The absence of systematic inquiry contrasts with Egyptian practical expertise in such fields as surveying, which was used both for orienting and planning buildings to remarkably fine tolerances and for the regular division of fields after the annual inundation of the Nile; the Egyptians also had surveyed and established the dimensions of their entire country by the beginning of the Middle Kingdom. These precise tasks required both knowledge of astronomy and highly ingenious techniques, but they apparently were achieved with little theoretical analysis.

Whereas in the earliest periods Egypt seems to have been administered almost as the personal estate of the king, by the central Old Kingdom it had been divided into about 35 nomes, or provinces, each with its own officials. Administration was concentrated at the capital, where most of the central elite lived and died. In the nonmonetary Egyptian economy, its essential functions were the collection, storage, and redistribution of produce; the drafting and organization of manpower for specialized labour, probably including irrigation and flood protection works, and major state projects; and the supervision of legal matters. Administration and law were not fully distinct, and both depended ultimately on the king. The settlement of disputes was in part an administrative task, for which the chief guiding criterion was precedent, while contractual relations were regulated by the use of standard formulas. State and temple both partook in redistribution and held massive reserves of grain; temples were economic as well as religious institutions. In periods of decentralization similar functions were exercised by local grandees. Markets had only a minor role, and craftsmen were employees who normally traded only what they produced in their free time. The wealthiest officials escaped this pattern to some extent by receiving their income in the form of land and maintaining large establishments that included their own specialized workers.

The essential medium of administration was writing, reinforced by personal authority over the nonliterate 99 percent of the population; texts exhorting the young to be scribes emphasize that the scribe commanded while the rest did the work. Most officials (almost all of whom were men) held several offices and accumulated more as they progressed up a complex ranked hierarchy, at the top of which was the vizier, the chief administrator and judge. The vizier reported to the king, who in theory retained certain powers, such as authority to invoke the death penalty, absolutely.

Before the Middle Kingdom, the civil and the military were not sharply distinguished. Military forces consisted of local militias under their own officials and included foreigners, and nonmilitary expeditions to extract minerals from the desert or to transport heavy loads through the country were organized in similar fashion. Until the New Kingdom there was no separate priesthood. Holders of civil office also had priestly titles, and priests had civil titles. Often priesthoods were sinecures: their chief significance was the income they brought. The same was true of the minor civil titles accumulated by high officials. At a lower level, minor priesthoods were held on a rotating basis by “laymen” who served every fourth month in temples. State and temple were so closely interconnected that there was no real tension between them before the late New Kingdom.

Sources, calendars, and chronology
For all but the last century of Egyptian prehistory, whose neolithic and later phases are normally termed “predynastic,” evidence is exclusively archaeological; later native sources have only mythical allusions to such remote times. The Dynastic period of native Egyptian rulers is generally divided into 30 dynasties, following the Aegyptiaca of the Greco-Egyptian writer Manetho of Sebennytos (early 3rd century BCE), excerpts of which are preserved in the works of later writers. Manetho apparently organized his dynasties by the capital cities from which they ruled, but several of his divisions also reflect political or dynastic changes—that is, changes of the party holding power. He gave the lengths of reign of kings or of entire dynasties and grouped the dynasties into several periods, but, because of textual corruption and a tendency toward inflation, Manetho’s figures cannot be used to reconstruct chronology without supporting evidence and analysis.

Manetho’s prime sources were earlier Egyptian king lists, the organization of which he imitated. The most significant preserved example of a king list is the Turin Papyrus (Turin Canon), a fragmentary document in the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy, which originally listed all kings of the 1st through the 17th dynasty, preceded by a mythical dynasty of gods and one of the “spirits, followers of Horus.” Like Manetho’s later work, the Turin document gave reign lengths for individual kings, as well as totals for some dynasties and longer multidynastic periods.

In early periods the kings’ years of reign were not consecutively numbered but were named for salient events, and lists were made of the names. More-extensive details were added to the lists for the 4th and 5th dynasties, when dates were assigned according to biennial cattle censuses numbered through each king’s reign. Fragments of such lists are preserved on the Palermo Stone, an inscribed piece of basalt (at the Regional Museum of Archaeology in Palermo, Italy), and related pieces in the Cairo Museum and University College London; these are probably all parts of a single copy of an original document of the 5th dynasty.

The Egyptians did not date by eras longer than the reign of a single king, so a historical framework must be created from totals of reign lengths, which are then related to astronomical data that may allow whole periods to be fixed precisely. This is done through references to astronomical events and correlations with the three calendars in use in Egyptian antiquity. All dating was by a civil calendar, derived from the lunar calendar, which was introduced in the first half of the 3rd millennium BCE. The civil year had 365 days and started in principle when Sirius, or the Dog Star—also known in Greek as Sothis (Ancient Egyptian: Sopdet)—became visible above the horizon after a period of absence, which at that time occurred some weeks before the Nile began to rise for the inundation. Every 4 years the civil year advanced one day in relation to the solar year (with 3651/4 days), and after a cycle of about 1,460 years it would again agree with the solar calendar. Religious ceremonies were organized according to two lunar calendars that had months of 29 or 30 days, with extra, intercalary months every three years or so.

Five mentions of the rising of Sirius (generally known as Sothic dates) are preserved in texts from the 3rd to the 1st millennium, but by themselves these references cannot yield an absolute chronology. Such a chronology can be computed from larger numbers of lunar dates and cross-checked from solutions for the observations of Sirius. Various chronologies are in use, however, differing by up to 40 years for the 2nd millennium BCE and by more than a century for the beginning of the 1st dynasty. The chronologies offered in most publications up to 1985 have been thrown into some doubt for the Middle and New kingdoms by a restudy of the evidence for the Sothic and especially the lunar dates. For the 1st millennium, dates in the Third Intermediate period are approximate; a supposed fixed year of 945 BCE, based on links with the Bible, turns out to be variable by a number of years. Late period dates (664–332 BCE) are almost completely fixed. Before the 12th dynasty, plausible dates for the 11th can be computed backward, but for earlier times dates are approximate. A total of 955 years for the 1st through the 8th dynasty in the Turin Canon has been used to assign a date of about 3100 BCE for the beginning of the 1st dynasty, but this requires excessive average reign lengths, and an estimate of 2925 BCE is preferable. Radiocarbon and other scientific dating of samples from Egyptian sites have not improved on, or convincingly contested, computed dates. More-recent work on radiocarbon dates from Egypt does, however, yield results encouragingly close to dates computed in the manner described above.

King lists and astronomy give only a chronological framework. A vast range of archaeological and inscriptional sources for Egyptian history survive, but none of them were produced with the interpretation of history in mind. No consistent political history of ancient Egypt can be written. The evidence is very unevenly distributed; there are gaps of many decades; and in the 3rd millennium BCE no continuous royal text recording historical events was inscribed. Private biographical inscriptions of all periods from the 5th dynasty (c. 2465–c. 2325 BCE) to the Roman conquest (30 BCE) record individual involvement in events but are seldom concerned with their general significance. Royal inscriptions from the 12th dynasty (1938–1756 BCE) to Ptolemaic times aim to present a king’s actions according to an overall conception of “history,” in which he is the re-creator of the order of the world and the guarantor of its continued stability or its expansion. The goal of his action is to serve not humanity but the gods, while nonroyal individuals may relate their own successes to the king in the first instance and sometimes to the gods. Only in the decentralized intermediate periods did the nonroyal recount internal strife. Kings did not mention dissent in their texts unless it came at the beginning of a reign or a phase of action and was quickly and triumphantly overcome in a reaffirmation of order. Such a schema often dominates the factual content of texts, and it creates a strong bias toward recording foreign affairs, because in official ideology there is no internal dissent after the initial turmoil is over. “History” is as much a ritual as a process of events; as a ritual, its protagonists are royal and divine. Only in the Late period did these conventions weaken significantly. Even then, they were retained in full for temple reliefs, where they kept their vitality into Roman times.

Despite this idealization, the Egyptians were well aware of history, as is clear from their king lists. They divided the past into periods comparable to those used by Egyptologists and evaluated the rulers not only as the founders of epochs but also in terms of their salient exploits or, especially in folklore, their bad qualities. The Demotic Chronicle, a text of the Ptolemaic period, purports to foretell the bad end that would befal

71.Once upon a time in a small village nestled between rolling hills and meandering streams, there lived a young girl named Lila and her family. They were a humble family struggling to make ends meet, facing the harsh realities of poverty that cast a shadow over their simple lives.
Lila's father, a hardworking man with calloused hands, toiled in the fields from dawn to dusk, barely earning enough to feed his family. Lila's mother, a gentle soul with tired eyes, did her best to stretch every coin, turning meagre ingredients into nourishing meals.
Despite their efforts, the weight of poverty pressed heavily on the family. The small, weather-beaten cottage they called home echoed with the sombre whispers of their struggles. Lila, a bright-eyed girl with dreams as vast as the starlit sky, often found herself yearning for a life beyond their meagre existence.
One day, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting hues of orange and pink across the sky, Lila sat on the worn-out doorstep, gazing at the distant hills. The air was heavy with the scent of hardship, yet Lila's spirit remained unbroken. She envisioned a world where laughter echoed freely, and hunger was but a distant memory.
One evening, as the family gathered around the flickering flame of a dying candle, Lila shared her dreams with a spark of hope in her eyes. Despite the reality that clung to them like a persistent shadow, her family listened intently, captivated by her vision of a brighter future.
Days turned into weeks, and a subtle change took root within the family. Instead of succumbing to the weight of their poverty, they began to find solace in each other's company. They discovered joy in the simplest of moments—a shared meal, a heartfelt laugh, and the warmth of togetherness.
As seasons changed and the village transformed, so did Lila's family. Through resilience and unity, they weathered the storms of life with grace. While their pockets may not have been filled with riches, their hearts overflowed with love and gratitude for the richness of family bonds.
And so, in the small village where hope once seemed scarce, a family learned that true wealth wasn't measured in coins but in the strength of their spirits and the love they shared. Lila's dreams, once confined by the shackles of poverty, began to take flight, carried by the wings of determination and familial love.

Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's death.
It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled hints that revealed in half concealing. Her husband's friend Richards was there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when intelligence of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of "killed." He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram, and had hastened to forestall any less careful, less tender friend in bearing the sad message.

She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same, with a paralyzed inability to accept its significance. She wept at once, with sudden, wild abandonment, in her sister's arms. When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone. She would have no one follow her.

There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.

She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which some one was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.

79.Create a YAML template for this theory:
Solid-state theory owes much of its success to constructive uses of the Bloch’s theorem (Kittel 1976). The latter applies to systems that are either naturally periodic or made periodic by replicationof the computational supercell throughout space. The principal advantage of periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) for modelling crystal defects is that they eliminate surfaces and preserve translational invariance, the fundamental property of the crystal lattice. However, the advantages of using PBC often come at a price: instead of a single defect of interest, the periodic closure of the system introduces an infinite array of defects whose interaction may distort the computed properties of the defect. The unwanted effects of periodicity can be large for the defects producing long-range fields, such as electrostatic fields of charged defects or elastic fields of lattice dislocations. In order to extract properties of indi vidual defects from the properties of periodic arrays, such spurious contributions should be accurately evaluated. The effects of PBCs are usually considered by embedding the simulation cell in an infinite and periodic array of image supercells that are exact replicas of the primary cell. In this context, the elastic fields of the defect in PBCs can be constructed by superimposing the fields produced by the defect in the primary simulationcell and image fields of its periodic replicas. Similarly, the superfluous image energy can be computed by summing the interaction energies between the primary and image defects. Unfortunately, in some important cases the image sum is only conditionally convergent. The Riemann series theorem states that, by regrouping the terms, it is possible to make such sums converge to an arbitrarily chosen limit (Whittaker and Watson 1958). A similar problem arises in summing electrostatic energy in ionic crystals, known as the Madelung summation (de Leeuw 1980, Smith 1981, Borwein et al. 1985). If such is the case, a straightforward summationusing some naı¨ve grouping of terms will fail to provide a definite answer of the image effect. For the specific case of computing dislocation image energies in PBCs, the existing techniques have been limited to isotropic elasticity or to special dislocation arrangements in the periodic supercell (Gulluoglu et al. 1989, Wang and LeSar 1995, Blase et al. 2000, Ismail-Beigi and Arias 2000). In this paper, we develop a robust method that is applicable to general anisotropic elasticity and arbitrary dislocation configurations in periodic supercells. The method follows from the observation that, when summing the fields produced by an infinite periodic array of sources, conditional convergence and the breaking of periodicity are related. By fixing the latter, the conditional convergent sum is regularized to its physical solution. We then establish a connection between the conditional convergence of image energy and that of the potential field of dislocations. The image energy is regularized by subtracting the non-periodic component of the potential field, which is conveniently carried out by introducing a set of probing ‘ghost’ dislocations that interact with image dislocations. We present several key applications selected to demonstrate the power and applicability of the method to modelling dislocations in PBCs.

81.Can you compose a lovely sonnet in this matter where Hegel romanticizes the idea of consciousness - 
Hegel was an idealist. He said consciousness is the reality. He did not say like Frederic Nietzsche ‘I think therefore, I am.’ Hegel indicated, idea or consciousness is the real arbiter. Unlike Nietzsche he said matter is not use less. The only thing is idea is primary and matter follows. Marx who became more famous than Hegel, almost altered the whole applecart of Hegel. Marx said matter is primary and consciousness follows. He erected his whole intellectual edifice on the critique of Hegel. Marx took the dialectical methodology from Hegel, he simply replaced it with dialectics in matter. Therefore, Marx declared Hege was standing on his head, I have made him to stand on his legs. It is true and Marx realized ‘if there wouldn’t have been Hegel, there would have been no Marx. Hegel proposed and popularized the scheme of change rooted in dialectics. Hegel said ideas or consciousness is always in a state of flux. There is always a dominant idea, which is the idea of the age. A new idea emerges from the womb of the dominant idea or thesis. The new idea has the potentiality of defeating the old idea. In its infancy, the new idea or the anti- thesis is weak but gradually it becomes strong and ultimately it defeats the thesis. This clash and dialectics produces, the synthesis. Synthesis is not entirely new; rather it has many elements of the new idea, some elements of the old idea or the thesis and some entirely new ideas which no body had expected beforehand. Reality is also not constant; it changes according to time. Man is the product of his time, so ideas are also product of time. One thing is constant i.e., the basic idea. This basic idea or absolute idea is the monopoly of God. So, reality is also the monopoly of God. Reason is the basis of reality Reason is a central ides is Hegelian philosophy. Hegel gave an entirely new meaning to reason. He said reason is idea reached by dialectical method and logical inferences. Reason in the human realm has its limitations. Absolute reason is the monopoly of perfect spirit and perfect spirit is the monopoly of God. This reason has another bearing in state. The social conditions are moving towards perfect spirit and therefore, towards a perfect state. This movement is also a movement of reality from the immature consciousness to more substantive consciousness. Real is therefore, according to Hegel a dialectical view of things around or encountered by people. Reality has many layers, so the view of reality is always multi-layered. This is something else for people who are powerful at one time. The state is controlled by those who have a better, multi-layered and dialectical view of reality. Rational is real and the real is rational because; in the consciousness of reality, reason is the criterion; in the rational again reason is the criterion. In reality the perception is marked by different layers and which is a dialectical view, a view in which different perceptions are clashing with each other and a dominant perception emerges. In the same manner, in rationality reason is applied or reasoning is applied to the substance. So, both reality and rationality reach the same conclusion.

83.In an era where environmental consciousness is paramount, businesses are increasingly recognizing the importance of adopting sustainable practices to reduce their ecological footprint. This is especially true for manufacturing companies, which historically have been associated with resource-intensive processes and environmental degradation. In this article, we will explore how a forward-thinking manufacturing company has embraced sustainable practices to minimize its environmental impact.

The Need for Change:
Traditional manufacturing processes have often been criticized for their adverse effects on the environment, including high energy consumption, waste generation, and pollution. The negative impact on natural resources and ecosystems has raised concerns among consumers, investors, and regulatory bodies. In response, some companies are proactively seeking ways to integrate sustainability into their operations.

Key Sustainable Practices:

Energy Efficiency:
One of the first steps toward sustainability is optimizing energy consumption. The manufacturing company in focus has invested in energy-efficient technologies and equipment. This not only reduces its carbon footprint but also lowers operational costs in the long run. Implementation of smart technologies, such as energy-efficient lighting and machinery, contributes significantly to this effort.

Waste Reduction and Recycling:
Adopting a circular economy approach, the company has implemented measures to minimize waste generation. This includes recycling materials, reusing resources internally, and adopting eco-friendly packaging. By minimizing waste sent to landfills, the company not only reduces its environmental impact but also contributes to the conservation of natural resources.

Supply Chain Sustainability:
The manufacturing company recognizes that sustainability goes beyond its own operations. It actively collaborates with suppliers to ensure that raw materials are sourced responsibly. This includes assessing the environmental impact of suppliers and favoring those who adhere to sustainable practices. The company is committed to creating a supply chain that promotes ethical sourcing and reduces the overall ecological footprint.

Green Innovation:
The company is dedicated to staying at the forefront of green innovation. Research and development efforts are focused on creating environmentally friendly products and processes. By investing in sustainable technologies and exploring alternative materials, the company aims to set new industry standards for eco-friendly manufacturing.

Water Conservation:
Recognizing the importance of water as a finite resource, the manufacturing company has implemented water-saving measures within its facilities. These include the use of advanced water recycling systems and the adoption of water-efficient manufacturing processes. By reducing water consumption, the company not only minimizes its impact on local water sources but also contributes to global water conservation efforts.

Benefits and Challenges:
While the journey toward sustainability brings about numerous benefits, including enhanced brand reputation, increased customer loyalty, and potential cost savings, it is not without challenges. The initial costs of adopting sustainable practices can be significant, and companies may face resistance from stakeholders accustomed to traditional methods. However, the long-term advantages and the positive impact on the environment make the transition worthwhile.

Conclusion:
The manufacturing company's commitment to sustainability serves as an inspiring example of how businesses can evolve to meet the demands of an environmentally conscious world. By embracing energy efficiency, waste reduction, responsible sourcing, and innovation, this company not only reduces its ecological footprint but also sets a precedent for others in the industry. As more businesses follow suit, the collective impact on the environment can be substantial, ushering in a new era of responsible and sustainable manufacturing.

85.In an era marked by rapid technological advancements, the healthcare industry is no exception to the transformative power of digital innovation. One notable example is the recent digital transformation undertaken, a leading healthcare institution committed to providing cutting-edge medical care. This strategic shift towards digitization aims to revolutionize patient care and streamline operational processes, ultimately ensuring a more efficient and patient-centric healthcare experience.
One of the key pillars of this digital transformation is the implementation of an integrated Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. This state-of-the-art technology consolidates patient information, medical history, and treatment plans into a secure and accessible digital platform. This not only eliminates the need for cumbersome paper records but also enables healthcare professionals to access critical patient data in real-time. This immediate access to information facilitates quicker decision-making and enhances the overall quality of patient care.
Telemedicine has emerged as another vital component of healthcare institution’s digital evolution. The integration of virtual healthcare services allows patients to consult with healthcare professionals remotely, reducing the need for in-person visits for routine check-ups and follow-ups. This not only provides convenience for patients but also helps the hospital optimize its resources, leading to improved operational efficiency.
To further enhance patient experience, medical instution has introduced mobile applications that empower patients to actively engage in their healthcare journey. These apps enable users to schedule appointments, access their medical records, and receive personalized health information, fostering a more collaborative approach between healthcare providers and patients. The result is a more informed and empowered patient population actively participating in their own well-being.

87.Paul hated school. He did not do his homework. He did not like his teachers. Paul's father did not know what to do with him. His teachers did not know either. One afternoon, all his teachers at Pittsburgh High School met together with him to discuss his case. Paul was late. When he entered the room his teachers sat waiting for him.

He was tall for his age and very thin. His clothes were too small for him, but they were clean. He had a bright red flower in the button hole of his black jacket. One of the teachers asked Paul why he had come to the meeting. Paul said politely that he wanted to do better in school. This was a lie. Paul often lied.

His teachers began to speak. They had many complaints. One said Paul talked to the other students instead of paying attention to the lessons. Another said Paul always sat in class with his hands covering his eyes. A third teacher said Paul looked out the window instead of looking at her. His teachers attacked him without mercy.

Paul's eyebrows moved up and down as his teachers spoke. His smile never left his face, but his fingers shook as he touched the flower on his coat. At last the meeting was over. Paul's smile got even wider. He bowed gracefully and left the room.

His teachers were angry and confused. The art teacher spoke for all of them when he said there was something about Paul that he didn't understand. "I don't think he really means to be bad," he said. "There's just something wrong with that boy." Then the art teacher remembered one warm afternoon when Paul had fallen asleep in his class. Paul's face was white with thin blue veins under the skin. The boy's face looked tired and lined, like an old man's. His eyebrows moved up and down, even in his sleep.

There must be deeper probe of the causes. The 2019 essay topics; South Asian societies are organized not around states but around their plural cultures and identities, biased media is a real threat to democracy etc. are analytical essays. Descriptive essays are rare; in 2007 probably, there was an essay BPO boom in India. This is a classic example of descriptive essay. In 2019 the essay topic, Neglect of primary health and education are causes for backwardness, the 2017 essay topic Impact of the new economic measures on fiscal ties between states and union of India, the 2016 essay Water disputes between states in federal India and the 2014 essay Tourism: can this be the new big thing, are all examples of descriptive essays. Prepare on the startup boom, the tv series ‘shark tank India’. The next type can be issue based or debate oriented essays. Remember; the typology I present is not the last word on types and the essay topics, my categorization is not axiomatic. There can be and should be other bases and typologies as well as categorization. The issue-based topics are those which have clear cut two sides, so you have to debate in detail both the sides or multiple sides and after giving the plus and minus of different sides, take a stand in the way forward and give the plus points from your end. There are many examples and every year these topics are asked. In 2019 the topic, Rise of artificial intelligence: threat of jobless future or alternative job opportunities through reskilling or upskilling. In 2017 Fulfillment of new woman in India is a myth are issue based. I say there are some aspirational type essays, the topic can be, 50 gold medals in the Olympic, India as a super power in the next ten years or the quest for 5 trillion economies. Such essays are not imaginative; they have to be attempted in a realistic way. You have to present facts; how the aspirations can be fulfilled, what are the impediments or what can be the potential threats to the aspiration. You must have facts, if you have the facts, you should write. Broad expected areas: The question; can there be a pattern found in expected essay topics or can we say probably, these are the areas from where essay topics are set. I think yes; we can attempt a possible categorization of areas. One such area is women issues; you can definitely expect one essay on women. Note; all women issues are not same; normally what you do is; start writing from the Vedic age, this is wrong. Read the essay topic very carefully and then write. You must remember women in India still value their families more than their careers; there is a report; 21 percent women of the supervisory cadre leave their jobs for the sake of their families. So, the discourse on woman has many shades. Other than women, nothing is certain. The celebrated unpredictability of UPSC as I often say, can be very problematic. You simply scan the essay topics of the last five years, you will realize, how diverse they are. Even then, we can anticipate some of the broad areas; one is economy which includes industry, agriculture, animal husbandry finance etc. Then there is politics, not international politics but national politics; it can be democracy, federalism, media, elections, administrative policies etc. Then is education and health or broadly the social sector. Science and technology are very often popular topics; remember science and technology topics are generally issue based i.e. how these are beneficial or harmful for humanity.


89.I want this in a horror themed style story where students are advised on what to do and not to do, keep the length to its half and add thrilling bits in the middle:

How you begin: Essay paper require more time to understand the topics. Take at least 15 minutes to select both the topics. Underline the topics to mark parts of the essay. You have to make rough work, make the rough very brief, in points but should be clear and legible, when you are writing the essays, be articulate, see the rough and write and write carefully. Give relatively less time to the first essay and more time to the second essay. Dos: There are some do’s and some don’t do’s in essay writing. You write in a Sequence and that too logical sequence should be maintained in between the paragraphs i.e. in one paragraph, you write history and connect with the present. Sub-titles should be given and underline them. Give as many charts, diagrams, tables and maps etc. as much is possible. They should be relevant. Give quotes, phrases in the introduction and conclusion, write only those quotes which are relevant. You may remember many, do not write all those you remember. Write cautiously and carefully. Don’t dos: The don’t dos are also important; some people say write in a flow, I say don’t write in a flow, ideas run fast, your hands can not match the flight of ideas, so write carefully. Maintain the structure; begin with the introduction, then go on to elaborate, then analyze, then suggest or way forward and then conclude. A sequence has to be maintained, don’t mix up this structure or sequence. Don’t repeat your arguments and ideas at any cost. Don’t care for your writing and language, they will take their own care in course of time or even if you have bad hand writing the examiners have enough time to decipher them. Don’t give too many quotes or maps or charts, they may disturb the structure. Last words: Remember, no amount of direction, advice works for essay writing. This comes by writing. You join us and we will force you to write before us and we will examine your essay before you. So, why hesitate; start writing now. First write on any topic in 200 words; but mind you, maintain the structure even in 200 words. Then write an essay in 300 word, then gradually go on increasing the word number. Even in your final examination don’t write more than 1000 or 1050 words. Brevity is the best policy, the instruction is don’t write more than 1200 words, no where it is written don’t write in less than so many words. So; ready, get set and go.

93.“Courage and leadership are essential qualities in times of challenge and uncertainty. Mobilizing members collectively and standing firm against attacks on critical policy agendas require strong determination and unity. As history has shown, when people come together with a shared purpose, extraordinary results can be achieved.
Courage is the ability to confront difficulties and take action even in the face of adversity or opposition. It means having the strength to stand up for what is right, even if it is unpopular or difficult. Leadership, on the other hand, involves guiding and inspiring others towards a common goal, fostering teamwork, and making tough decisions when needed.
In times of crisis or when advocating for important policy changes, courage and leadership are especially vital. They provide the backbone for a group or organization to remain resolute and persistent in pursuing their objectives despite challenges or opposition.
It is important to recognize that maintaining a strong resolve in the face of opposition is not always easy. Doubts and pressures may arise, but it is during these times that courageous leaders can motivate others and keep the group focused on their shared mission.
By combining courage with effective leadership, groups can make significant progress towards achieving their policy agenda, even in the face of adversity. It requires a commitment to staying true to the organization's values and objectives, as well as an ability to adapt to changing circumstances while remaining firm in the pursuit of the overall goal.
As the world continues to evolve and new challenges emerge, the need for courageous leaders who can rally their members and remain steadfast in their policy agenda remains as crucial as ever. Together, with courage and leadership, positive change can be achieved and progress made towards a better future.”

Here is some info: The eagerly awaited trailer for the sixth installment of the Grand Theft Auto series was unexpectedly released by developer Rockstar, 15 hours ahead of its scheduled launch, following the circulation of a low-quality copy online. The 90-second teaser confirmed that the game will be set in the Miami-inspired Vice City and will feature a female protagonist named Lucia, marking the return of a female lead for the first time since the 1990s. Despite the excitement generated by the trailer, fans will have to endure a longer wait, as the game is not slated for release until 2025. This latest installment follows the monumental success of GTA V in 2013, which became the second best-selling video game of all time, trailing only Minecraft. The announcement of the upcoming trailer had already sparked global headlines in November, highlighting the immense anticipation surrounding GTA VI. The teaser showcases various scenes, including car races, boat parties, and a man pulling an alligator from a swimming pool, all set to the Americana sounds of Tom Petty's "Love is a Long Road." Gamers online, expressed their intrigue as a fan who typically streams multiplayer RPGs. They noted the historical male-centric nature of the series but believes that Lucia's inclusion will have a significant impact, potentially influencing other game developers to feature more female protagonists. However, several questions remain unanswered, including the supported gaming platforms. While the trailer did not disclose this information, Take-Two Interactive, the game's publisher, has confirmed that GTA VI will be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X upon its 2025 release. Details about the release date and a potential PC version are still pending, with previous games in the series following a pattern of PC releases several months after the console launch. Fans are also curious about the voice actor for Lucia, as the trailer did not reveal this information. The secrecy surrounding the game's development may be attributed to the overwhelming success of GTA V, which sold 190 million copies worldwide and continues to thrive through GTA Online. James Binns, chairman of gaming media firm Network N, emphasized the epic scale of the upcoming game, highlighting the substantial investment of over a billion dollars. The December release of the trailer was strategically timed to coincide with the franchise's 25th anniversary. Originally developed in Dundee in 1997 by DMA Design, later known as Rockstar North, the Grand Theft Auto series has achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success, though not without controversy. The first game's violent content even led to questions in the House of Lords.
